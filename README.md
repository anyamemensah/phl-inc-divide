# Philadelphia's Income Divide

This project displays differences in predominant household incomes (i.e., most common income ranges) in the City of Philadelphia by Census Tract for 2023. Data for this project were drawn from the United States (U.S.) Census Bureau:

- [Data table S1901 (Income in the Past 12 Months)](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST5Y2023.S1901?t=Income+and+Poverty&g=050XX00US42101$1400000)
- [2023 TIGER/Line Shapefiles](https://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2023/TRACT/tl_2023_42_tract.zip)
- [2023 U.S. Gazetteer](https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/2023_Gazetteer/2023_gaz_tracts_42.txt)
